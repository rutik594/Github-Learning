2.There is a team selection in project context menu from where we can push our project to index and commit.

3.Put commit msg and push.

4. One pop will come asking for pushing code to local repository before pushing it into github repository.

5.Give the path of repository which you have created in 1st step.

6.And then it will ask for destination which is nothing but github repository path.

7. and finally will ask for credentials which is username and password.

8. Twist is that here password is not Github account password. Here password is access token which can be created in below path of github.

9.  Settings -> Developer Setting -> Personal access tokens -> tokens -> and simply generate.

10. Above generated token will be your password. Enter credentials and project will be commited to github repository.
